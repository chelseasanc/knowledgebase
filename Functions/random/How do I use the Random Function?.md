The Random Function takes in two numbers and returns a random number between those bounds that is no more than 16 decimal places in length. Here's how to use it in a Flõ:

1. From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.
2. Find the Random Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. 
3. Drag data from other cards and drop it into the Input fields. You can also type a number into either field.
4. Add more cards to your Flõ: Channels, Functions, whatever you want to happen next. 
5. Drag the result from the Random card to an empty field in another card. 

Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won't help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card.
